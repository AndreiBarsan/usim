summary: "Resources allow comparisons to derive conditions for their levels"
description: |
  All Resources types support the boolean comparison operators, such as ``==``, ``>=``,
  or ``<``. The other operand must be a respective resources type or a compatible dict.
  This creates a condition that triggers once the resources' levels satisfy
  the comparison.
