    Request usage of a ``resource``

    This event is triggered once the request has been granted by the resource.
    If the resource has sufficient capacity, the request is granted immediately.
    Otherwise, the request is delayed until another request is released.

    A request should always be either cancelled before being granted
    or released after being granted.
    A request can be used in a :keyword:`with` statement to automatically
    cancel or release it as appropriate at the end of the context.
    Note that success of the usage request is not automatically
    waited on -- this must be done explicitly if desired.
